## Description

Displays a binary value of a number between 0 and 1023 using the 10 LEDs in the LED Ring.

Enables the Circuit Playground to display large numbers precisely.

Can be used to display readings from sensors.

If the decimal number is in range, it will blink green prior to showing the binary number. If a decimal number is out of range, it will blink red prior to showing the binary number.
