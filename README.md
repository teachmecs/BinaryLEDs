## Description

Displays a binary value of a number between 0 and 1023 using the 10 LEDs in the LED Ring.

Enables the Circuit Playground to display large numbers precisely.

Can be used to display readings from sensors.

If the decimal number is not within range, it will blink red instead of showing the binary number.
